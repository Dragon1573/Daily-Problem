Among my readers, there are relatively many college students or freshmen. Now, in October, this is the last small peak of corporate recruitment this year. I sincerely hope that every reader can enter a big company for internship or work, and take me to glory in the future `^_^`.

I have been working for three years and will soon enter the [Meituan group](https://about.meituan.com/en-about.html) for work. Here, as a person who has come over, I will give a few suggestions and maybe help you to make fewer detours.

## Resume related

1. Try to be as concise as possible, keep it on one page, and HR will not be able to filter a resume for more than 10 seconds.
2. When describing the project, keep it compact. For example:
    - Built a web project about the separation of the front and back ends of ...
    - Built a `Rest Api` using Java or Python
    - Built an HTML5 or mobile project with Vue, Kotlin or other languages and has 1000+ users
3. Reply `CV template` in the background of the Wechat Channel, I will simplify my resume template for your reference.

## Interview

1. Find someone for inner recommendation. Search for classmates, friends or even friends of friends. Ask them for help, which can increase many opportunities and save at least 10 times of the time.
2. Prepare a personal cover letter, simply explain why you are qualified for the position. And then search for the recruiter or Rerson in Charge of the favorite company's mailbox, [WeChat](https://www.wechat.com/en/), [Weibo](https://weibo.com/), etc.. The general response rate is much higher than untargeted delivery.
3. If you have no alternative ways, then diliver you resume generaly. Browse for [Lagou](https://www.lagou.com/), [Boss Zhipin](https://www.zhipin.com/) and keep sending you resume everyday.

I strongly recommend the first two ways. They can save a lot of time.

## Interview preparation

1. Solve questions more often. The following points must be asked when having interviews with large companies:
    - Hashmap
    - Linked list
    - Stack
    - Queue and Deque
    - Tree (includes Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree and Red Black Tree)
    - Heap
    - Graph (directional or non-directional)
    - Array or Sequence
2. Try to practice by hand. For many real interviews, there are only a piece of paper and a pen.
3. Carefully prepare one or two projects and talk with the interviewer. For beginners, the most important thing is to show the enthusiasm and attitude of learning.

## Afterword

I have revealed that there are many Big Shots among my readers. Such as *Fudan University*, *Tongji University*, *National Chiao Tung University* graduates and many graduated students who are studying abroad. So everyone can put their resumes into my Knowledge Planet. Accept the advice of the Big Shots, learn from each other, and join the big company together. I will also take the time to review and give you some suggestions for revision.
