# Daily Problem

**The Original Author: [@mjd507](https://github.com/mjd507)**

## Description

***Daily Problem*** is a WeChat Channel owned by [@mjd507](https://github.com/mjd507). He publishes a programming quiz once a day, which was asked by those well-known corporations.

Most of the answer can be found on ***Google***. However, there's still someone have no ability to get access with *Google*. So I create this repository, sharing my solutions with others. The Markdown comments and source codes are mixed in ***JupyterLab*** format (\*.ipynb). *GitHub* supports this format online and display the same as in *JupyterLab*. If you want to run the file on your device locally, please install ***Anaconda with Python 3.7*** and load this repository with *JupyterLab* or ***Jupyter Notebook***.

My solution may not the best, but it works! If you have any better solutions, please fork this repository and create a Pull Request on my repository. Thank you!
