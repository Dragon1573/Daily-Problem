## Description

*Daily Problem* is a WeChat Channel owned by [@mjd507](https://github.com/mjd507). He publishes a programming quiz once a day, which was asked by those well-known corporations. 

Most of the answer can be found on Google. However, there's still someone have no ability to get access with Google. So I create this repository, sharing my solutions with others. The Markdown comments and source codes are mixed in **JupyterLab format (\*.ipynb)**. Please install **Anaconda with Python 3.7** and load this repository with **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**. 

My solution may not the best, but it works! If you have any better solutions, please fork this repository and create a Pull Request on my repository. Thank you!
